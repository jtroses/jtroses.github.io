The example below uses a dataset that has attributes about individuals, including their salary, gender, education level, etc. The dataset also includes which whether or not the an individual is in a senior leadership role ore not. We use the attributes in the data to predict whether or not an individual is a senior leadership role or not based on some of the attributed from the data.
